# CodeML-Hackathon---Air-Canada

In this hackathon, we trained a neural network using tensorflow to automatically assign seats on a flight to customers who did not choose between ADVS and PREF.

Based on information such as seat price, number or location of seats left to purchase, route, travel purpose, etc, customers will be assigned a PREF or ADVS seat.
